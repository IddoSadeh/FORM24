## Files Overview

### Current Core Project Files

- **imuLoggerAndTransfer.ino**: Main Arduino sketch for the ESP32 that handles IMU data collection, SD card logging, and Bluetooth communication. This code allows the ESP32 to:
  - Record IMU (accelerometer/gyroscope) data to CSV files on an SD card
  - Receive commands via Bluetooth to start/stop logging
  - Transfer files from the SD card to a connected device
  - List and delete files on the SD card
  
- **bleClientGUI.py**: Python desktop application that provides a graphical interface to control the ESP32 logger. Features include:
  - Device scanning and connection management
  - Starting and stopping data logging
  - Viewing, downloading, and managing files on the ESP32's SD card
  - Live status updates and connection logs


- **imuProcess.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook for processing and analyzing collected IMU data.


### Old Core Project Files

- **IMUCollect.py**: Python script for collecting and processing IMU data received from the ESP32.

- **bleClient.py**: Simple Python Bluetooth Low Energy client for connecting to the ESP32 without the graphical interface.

- **bleimu.ino**: Arduino sketch for basic Bluetooth IMU data transmission from ESP32.


### Other Project Files

- **find_imu_bus.ino**: Utility sketch to detect and identify IMU devices on the I2C bus.

- **findblesmac.ino**: Utility sketch to find and display Bluetooth MAC addresses.
