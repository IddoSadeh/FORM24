Arduino Logger and Data Analysis
This project enables logging data from an Arduino device, saving it to a file, and analyzing the collected data using a Jupyter Notebook.

How to Run the Project
1. **Connect the Arduino**
- Connect your Arduino device to your computer via USB.
- Open the Arduino IDE and upload the appropriate script to the Arduino board.
2. **Adjust the COM Port** in `arduino_logger.py`
- Determine the COM port assigned to your Arduino. 
  - You can find this in the Arduino IDE under `Tools > Port`.
- Open the `arduino_logger.py` file and update the COM_PORT variable with the correct port.
1. Run `arduino_logger.py`
Run the script to start logging data from the Arduino:
bash
Copy code
python arduino_logger.py
The data will be saved to a .txt or .csv file in the same directory.
1. Analyze the Data
Open the load_data_test.ipynb notebook in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.
Modify the file path in the notebook to point to the data file generated by arduino_logger.py.
Run the cells in the notebook to visualize and analyze the collected data.


Project Files:
1. arduino_logger.py
This Python script connects to the Arduino, reads data from the serial port, and saves it to a file.
Key functionality:
Specify the COM_PORT to communicate with the Arduino.
Automatically handles serial communication and saves data in real-time.
2. load_data_test.ipynb
A Jupyter Notebook for loading and analyzing the data collected by the Arduino logger.
Key functionality:
Loads the saved data file.
Processes and visualizes the data using Python libraries like pandas and matplotlib.
3. Arduino Sketch
The code uploaded to the Arduino device.
Responsible for collecting sensor data and transmitting it via the serial port.
Customize this script to match the sensors connected to your Arduino.
Dependencies
Python Dependencies
Make sure you have the following Python packages installed:

pyserial: For serial communication.
pandas: For data manipulation.
matplotlib: For data visualization.
notebook: For running Jupyter Notebooks.
Install dependencies using:

bash
Copy code
pip install pyserial pandas matplotlib notebook
Troubleshooting
Serial Port Issues:

If you cannot connect to the Arduino, double-check the COM port in the Arduino IDE and update COM_PORT in arduino_logger.py.
Data File Not Found:

Ensure the data file path in load_data_test.ipynb matches the file created by arduino_logger.py.
Missing Python Packages:

Use pip to install any missing dependencies.
